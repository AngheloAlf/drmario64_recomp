# drmario64_recomp

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is just a repository for testing the recompilation technology.
> I won't make a release for this recompiled game. Don't ask for feature requests

## Known issues

- There's no multiple controller support. Just 1 player at a time.
- The extended aspect ratio is very jank.
- Application segfaults when it is closed.
- Very untested.

## Dependencies

- git
- C (c17) and C++ (c++20) compilers.
  - Clang 15 or newer is recommended.
- SDL2
  - This has to be installed from source under Linux.
  - For example:

    ```bash
    wget https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.26.1.tar.gz
    tar -xzf SDL2-2.26.1.tar.gz
    cd SDL2-2.26.1
    ./configure
    make -j $(nproc)
    sudo make install
    ```

- libgtk-3-dev

## Build

The listed commits are known to be able to build this repository.

Note that the following are Linux instructions. For building on Windows you'll
need Visual Studio and such. Refer to the Zelda recomp repo for Windows
instruction. You are on your own there.

- Clone with submodules (`git clone --recurse-submodules` or
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`).
- Follow the build instructions from the decomp repository up to running the
  `make setup` step (<https://github.com/AngheloAlf/drmario64>,
  commit `91dab37987bdad4d100958685cc10a011d4917dd`).
  - Grab the generated `baserom_uncompressed.us.z64` file at the root of the
    decomp folder and put it in the root of this project, rename it to
    `drmario64_uncompressed.us.z64`.
- Build the N64Recomp repo (<https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp>, commit
  `a13e5cff96686776b0e03baf23923e3c1927b770`) and copy the `build/N64Recomp` and
  `build/RSPRecomp` binaries to the root of this project.
- Run `./N64Recomp drmario64.us.toml` on the root of this
  project.
- Run `./RSPRecomp aspMain.us.toml` on the root of this
  project.
- Build this project by running:

```bash
cmake -B build/ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j $(nproc) --config Release
```

Possible options for the build type are `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo` and
`MinSizeRel`

This game will ask for a ROM when it is executed for the first time. You'll need
to select a vanilla US ROM to run, don't use the uncompressed one generated by
the decomp.
