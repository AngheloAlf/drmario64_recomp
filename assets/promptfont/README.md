## Special Glyphs
Please see the included ``glyphs.json`` file for all the relevant glyphs in the font. It includes the code point of every glyph along with a unique name to address it with and a general category. You should be able to use it to create an equivalent mapping of glyphs in your engine of choice.

## Engine Specifics
Since there's far too many engines out there and their methods vary a lot, we can't include guides in this repository. For specifics on how to use this font in your engine of choice, please consult their documentation on importing custom fonts and custom glyph ranges, and how to write text with specific unicode codepoints. Since this is literally just a font, it should not prove too difficult.

## Contributing Glyphs
For a brief guide on what to watch out for if you'd like to contribute to this font, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file. If you'd like to request new glyphs to be added, please comment on the [issue ticket]().
